[WELCOME TO CY-Books !!]

  CY-Books is a library management system designed by a team of first-year engineering students from CYTECH. 
The project aims to facilitate library management for librarians through a user-friendly graphical interface. Key features include user registration, book management, and loan tracking. 
The application integrates with a local database and dynamically retrieves book details from the API of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France (BNF).

The team consists of Zinedine Benzoua, Nadir Nehili, Flavio Martins Soares, Younes Kaddache, and Elouan Ekoka. The project is supervised by Madame Sirine Hawari.

CY-Books offers several essential features for library management. Librarians can register new users, modify their information, and ban them if necessary. 
The application also allows managing the book inventory, tracking loans and returns, and displaying overdue books. Users can search for books and users based on various criteria. 
The application displays the 20 most popular books of the last 30 days. Loan management includes checking borrowing limits and automatically detecting overdue books, with overdue users 
indicated in red and those who have reached their borrowing limit in orange. If a user returns at least three overdue books, they are automatically banned. 
Librarians can refresh the user list to update statuses and view each user's borrowing history.

We used IntelliJ IDEA for coding due to its advanced features like code completion, easy navigation, debugging, and integration with version control tools like Git. 
For the user interface, we chose JavaFX to create a rich and interactive graphical interface. MySQL with WampServer was selected for local development and PHPMyAdmin for database management.
We used JDBC MySQL Connector/J version 8.3.0 to connect Java applications to the MySQL database.
